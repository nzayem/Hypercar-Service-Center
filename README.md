# Hypercar-Service-Center

Simple Django project to simulate an electronic queuing system in a car maintenance shop.

2 screens are available, one for customers to display ticket numbers and estimated waiting time for each service.

And the second one is for operator who should press the next button to serve next customer.

Good project to apply the deque collection in a real-world app.
